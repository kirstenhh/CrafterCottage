Currently working on: Home + Furniture
	make furniture moveable in edit mode and interactable in use mode

#TODO:
map: a) new tilemap, b) set so random spawn is ONLY on tiles
home: edit mode -> pick up items by clicking
re-architect inventory (+ save to json between games)
save furniture placement to json too
Placed item: interact (z) to make animation happen
note for later: boss fights -> new crafting stations, same or higher 




An exploration and crafting game. 

Controls: focus on mouse-based movement indoors, keyboard outdoors
You: live in a cottage in the forest alone, (implied you're red riding hood's grandma?)
Cottage: display space for crafted items! and lots of room to put other things
Outside: a very large (or subsectioned?) forest with paths and clearings (predefined)
Other ends of paths: individual friends, plus some villages, and a town
On the paths: forageable crafting supplies (sheepwool bushes, cuttable trees, clay patches, etc)
			monsters: scissorbirds, tanglebeasts, wolves...
			bossfights: in clearings with suggestive markings, blocking paths
Friends: buy and sell your stuff regardless of quality, and give you presents
Markets: buy and sell based on quality
